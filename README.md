If your code files are cluttered, cramped, and cannot breathe, then they need moepadding.

moepadding is a simple source code formatting tool that adds empty lines between
top-scoped code objects, such as functions methods, and class interfaces.

Usage

mpad filename padding [-w]

By default, moepadding will not overwrite the input file and will write out to
moeout.

The -w flag will force overwrite of the input file.
